-- We re-opened the books.db file that we created in class.
-- the script for creating this table along with all other materials
-- is on the Class notes page:
-- https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall19/CSCI-UA.0060-001/notes/dbw_readings_sqlite_fa19.html

(base) 10-16-86-204:SQLite deena$ sqlite3 books.db
SQLite version 3.29.0 2019-07-10 17:32:03
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

-- There is only one table in the database.
sqlite> .tables
books

-- Here is the structure of the table.
sqlite> .schema books
CREATE TABLE books (
  title text NOT NULL,
  author text,
  year_written integer,
  edition text,
  price real,
  purchaseDate text,
  PRIMARY KEY(title)
  );

-- How many records are in the books table?

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books;
16

-- A question came up in class as to whether we could re-run the script anytime.
-- so we ran the script and checked on the results.

sqlite> .read books_script_sqlite.sql
sqlite> .tables
books

-- including a sample query:
sqlite> SELECT title,author,edition
   ...> FROM books
   ...> WHERE edition="Penguin"
   ...> ORDER BY title;
A Room of One's Own|Woolf, Virginia|Penguin
Anna Karenina|Tolstoy, Leo|Penguin

Sense and Sensibility|Austen, Jane|Penguin

-- I find it easier to display the data in columns so we changed the mode:
sqlite> .mode columns

-- Display all of the books written in the 19th century
-- in chronological order by year written:
