-- CSCI-UA.60-1 - CLASS WORKSHOP #1 - SQLITE

-- All of the data and the class handout are posted to:
-- https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall19/CSCI-UA.0060-001/notes/dbw_readings_sqlite_fa19.html

-- After creating the database and running the script, we checked to be sure 
-- that the table is available.

sqlite> .tables
deaths
sqlite> .schema deaths
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS 'deaths' (
	'Year'	TEXT,
	'Code_CauseName'	TEXT,
	'CauseName'	TEXT,
	'State'	TEXT,
	'Deaths'	INTEGER,
	'Age-adjustedDeathRate'	REAL
);

sqlite> .read deathCauses_script.sql
sqlite> .tables
deaths
sqlite> .schema deaths
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS 'deaths' (
	'Year'	TEXT,
	'Code_CauseName'	TEXT,
	'CauseName'	TEXT,
	'State'	TEXT,
	'Deaths'	INTEGER,
	'Age-adjustedDeathRate'	REAL
);

-- (1) How many records are in this table?

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deaths;
14144

-- (2) Which is the first year included in this table? The last year?

sqlite> SELECT MIN(Year),MAX(Year)
   ...> FROM deaths;
1999,2015

-- (3) If the years span a longer period, how can you see if there are data for every year?

sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT Year
   ...> FROM deaths
   ...> ORDER BY Year;
1999
2000
2001
2002
2003
2004
2005
2006
2007
2008
2009
2010
2011
2012
2013
2014
2015

-- or you could use:

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Year) FROM deaths;
17

-- We will return to this in the next class.

-- (4) Which causes of death are included in this table? List all of the diseases or causes in alphabetical order.

sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT Code_CauseName
   ...> FROM deaths
   ...> ORDER BY Code_CauseName;

-- We decided to delete the records for "United States" as these
-- appear to be duplicated data.

-- Had we not checked ... most of our remaining statistics would have been
-- wrong by a considerable factor.

-- First we used a SELECT query to determine how many records to remove:
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*)
   ...> FROM deaths
   ...> WHERE State = "United States";
272                                     

-- Since there are 16 distinct causes tracked and 17 years of data,
-- 272 records sounds correct.

sqlite> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CauseName) FROM deaths;
16                                      
sqlite> SELECT (272/16)
   ...> ;
17                                      

-- There are currently this many records:
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deaths;
14144                                   

-- so after deletion we should end up with (14144-272) records:
sqlite> SELECT (14144-272);
13872                                   

-- We ran the DELETE query:
sqlite> DELETE
   ...> FROM deaths
   ...> WHERE State = "United States";

-- and checked to be sure we have the correct total, which we do:
sqlite> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deaths;
13872                                   
sqlite> 
-- We will work on the remaining queries in the next class.
