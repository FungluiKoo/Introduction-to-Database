-- the first record (which would require further research "on the ground"),
-- that military bases comprise much of this result set. We discussed

-- Next we turned to a discussion of WHERE and HAVING clauses.

-- Use WHERE to select individual records in the dataset.

-- But this time we asked, which states have a population over 20,000,000?
