-- WORKSHOP, PART 2

-- This is the table we are using:

sqlite> .schema deaths
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS 'deaths' (
	'Year'	TEXT,
	'Code_CauseName'	TEXT,
	'CauseName'	TEXT,
	'State'	TEXT,
	'Deaths'	INTEGER,
	'Age-adjustedDeathRate'	REAL
);

-- Question 8: How many deaths are there for each cause of over 2,000,000 
-- deaths in this table?

-- For this question, we looked at causes with the most deaths to assess the data.
-- Then we discussed the differences between WHERE and HAVING.

-- This query requires the keyword HAVING because we are looking to restrict
-- our resulting dataset by criteria based on the GROUP BY results rather than
-- based on individual records (which would use WHERE).

-- We returned to QUESTION #3:
-- If the years span a longer period, how can you see if there are data for every year?

-- A student in the class asked for a boolean-type answer.

-- These queries can be built or worked on together to find the result.
